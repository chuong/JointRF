The materials of the paper: Efficient Misalignment-Robust Multi-Focus Microscopical Images Fusion.

UnregisteredImages: The database includes 15 groups of unregistered multi-focus images with size of 4112 × 3008 and 1232 × captured by the optical microscope.
Result: It includes the full-scale fused images generated by different paremeter settings of the number of the octaves and layers in the scale space.
code: It is the source code of our alogrithm, which is implented by C++ combined with the openCV 3.0 library.
